* how long is @lower?
* is getPars going to do the right thing for GLMMs
(i.e., should be the length of the actually optimized parameter set,
which is length(theta) for LMMs or GLMMs with nAGQ==0, otherwise sum(lengths(theta,beta))

all get/set methods, so far, always exclude beta (refactor? add an argument?)

we need functions that *convert* from Pars to ProfPars and vice versa
