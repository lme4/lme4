@article{henderson_1982,
	Abstract = {The model generally considered in analysis of covariance has all levels of classification factors and interactions fixed, and also covariate regression coefficients fixed. Mixed models are more appropriate in most applications. A summary of estimation and hypothesis testing for analysis of covariance in the mixed model, including the case of random regression coefficients, is presented. Higher-level covariate regressions (i.e., regressions in which, for all levels of a factor or interaction, all observations on the same level have a common covariate value) are discussed. Nonestimability problems that result from defining such covariates at the levels of fixed effects are illustrated. The case of nonhomogeneous covariate regressions in the mixed model is considered in the context of interpreting predicted future differences among levels of a given factor or interaction. Nonhomogeneous regressions complicate interpretations only when they are associated with the contrast(s) of interest among fixed effects in the model. The question of whether the regressions are homogeneous is itself often of substantive interest. Different random regression coefficients associated with the levels of a random effect are also examined.},

	Abstract = {For given data (ti, yi), i = 1, ⋯, m, we consider the least squares fit of nonlinear models of the form $\eta(\mathbf{a, \alpha};t) = \sum^n_{j = 1} a_j \varphi_j(\mathbf{\alpha};t),\quad \mathbf{a} \in \mathscr{R}^n, \mathbf{\alpha} \in \mathscr{R}^k.$ For this purpose we study the minimization of the nonlinear functional r(a, α) = ∑m i = 1 (yi - η(a, α, ti))2. It is shown that by defining the matrix {Φ(α)}i,j = φj(α; ti), and the modified functional r2(α) = |y - Φ(α)Φ+ (α)y|2 2, it is possible to optimize first with respect to the parameters α, and then to obtain, a posteriori, the optimal parameters $\hat{\mathbf{a}}$ . The matrix Φ+(α) is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of Φ(α). We develop formulas for the Frechet derivative of orthogonal projectors associated with Φ(α) and also for Φ+(α), under the hypothesis that Φ(α) is of constant (though not necessarily full) rank. Detailed algorithms are presented which make extensive use of well-known reliable linear least squares techniques, and numerical results and comparisons are given. These results are generalizations of those of H. D. Scolnik [20] and Guttman, Pereyra and Scolnik [9].},

	volume = {53},
	abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood {(REML)} is now well established as a method for estimating the parameters of the general Gaussian linear model with a structured covariance matrix, in particular for mixed linear models. Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T\${\textasciicircum}2\$ type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different {REML} analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

	abstract = {The estimation of variance-covariance matrices through optimization of an objective function, such as a log-likelihood function, is usually a difficult numerical problem. Since the estimates should be positive semi-definite matrices, we must use constrained optimization, or employ a parametrization that enforces this condition. We describe here five different parametrizations for variance-covariance matrices that ensure positive definiteness, thus leaving the estimation problem unconstrained. We compare the parametrizations based on their computational efficiency and statistical interpretability. The results described here are particularly useful in maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimation in linear and non-linear mixed-effects models, but are also applicable to other areas of statistics.},

This disease is caused by the small-colony type of Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides ({MmmSC).} Transmission occurs from direct and repeated contacts between sick and healthy animals. Veterinary services recently reported a resurgence of {CBPP} in the province of West Wellega, in the Ethiopian highlands. A research program was set up to estimate the epidemiological parameters of the within-herd infection spread. A follow-up survey was implemented in 71 sampled herds of the Boji district (West Wellega province). Fifteen herds were classified as newly infected and used in a serological- and clinical-incidence study. The overall 16-month cumulative sero-incidence risk was 34\%. Clinical cases were recorded for 39\% of the seropositive cattle; case-fatality risk was 13\%. There was no evidence of benefit on infection spread of {CBPP-control} measures used locally by farmers (isolation or antibiotic treatments of sick animals). This might be related to a lack of power in the statistical analyses or to a quality problem for the medications used (and more generally, for health-care delivery in the Boji district).},
