    \item{\code{replicate}}{a factor with levels \code{1} to \code{15}}
    \item{\code{recipe}}{a factor with levels \code{A}, \code{B} and \code{C}}
    \item{\code{temperature}}{an ordered factor with levels \code{175}
      < \code{185} < \code{195} < \code{205} < \code{215} < \code{225}}
    \item{\code{angle}}{a numeric vector giving the angle at which the
      cake broke.}
    \item{\code{temp}}{numeric value of the baking temperature (degrees F).}

\description{
  Data on the breakage angle of chocolate cakes made with
  three different recipes and baked at six different
  temperatures.  This is a split-plot design with the
  recipes being whole-units and the different temperatures
  being applied to sub-units (within replicates). The
  experimental notes suggest that the replicate numbering
  represents temporal ordering.
}
\details{
  The \code{replicate} factor is nested within the
  \code{recipe} factor, and \code{temperature} is nested
  within \code{replicate}.
