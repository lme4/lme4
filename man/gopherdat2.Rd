\details{
  Details of the study is described in \insertCite{ozgul2009upper}{lme4} as
  follows:
  "The fieldwork was conducted between 2003 and 2006, during late spring/summer 
  (Mayâ€“September). Systematic surveys were conducted to locate tortoise burrows 
  and shell remains from deceased tortoises at study sites and consisted of a 
  line of four to eight observers spaced 10 m apart walking parallel transects 
  across the study area."

## Simple model gives a singular fit:
gopher_glmer <- glmer(shells ~ factor(year) + prev + offset(log(Area))
                   + (1|Site), data = gopherdat2, family = "poisson")
## The site-level variance for this model is indeed zero:
VarCorr(gopher_glmer)
## So a Poisson GLM gives the same answer here:
gopher_glm <- glm(shells ~ factor(year) + prev + offset(log(Area)),
                  data = gopherdat2, family = "poisson")
all.equal(fixef(gopher_glmer), coef(gopher_glm))
